<p>Sam Hurwitz is a fourth year PhD student at the history department at Boston College. Sam's research interests concern Boston history, LGBTQ+ history and 20th century American history. They graduated from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 2017 with a degree in History. Sam started to become interested in Digital Humanities in the first year of their PhD program and obtained a certificate in Digital Humanities in May of 2022. After graduation, Sam would like to find employment in a DH related field. Currently, they are a Digital Humanities Program Assistant at Boston College’s O’Neill Library. They are eager in expanding their Digital Humanities skillset through projects such as this one. Sam believes that building their DH know-how will enable quicker access to digital scholarship and content, increase the public’s understanding of the local history of Boston and the history of the Boston’s LGBTQ+ communities and provide a framework for future scholars to further reveal how Boston’s queer and gender non-conforming populations have lived and survived over the years.
